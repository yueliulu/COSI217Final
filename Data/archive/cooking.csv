"TLDR;

How to be a JS Chef 🧑‍🍳

👀 Learn the basics of HTML and CSS
📝 Use a code editor
🍖 Write JS code in chunks

💬 Use comments
📚 Keep a code swipe-file
💡 Most problems have existing solutions

⌛️ JS takes time and practice
🤔 Don't memorize everything
🗓️ Practice regularly"

So dream big, and let your heart soar,
And don't be afraid to try,
For in the end, it's so much more,
Than the fear of falling from the sky.🗝️"
"To lands both near and far?
Or would you take a different path,
And dream of love and peace,✨🗝️
Where every heart could find a match,
And all troubles could finally cease?
No matter what your dream may be,
Remember this simple truth:
The only limit that you see,🤚"
"How big would you dream, my friend,😐
If failure was not your fear?✨
Would your imagination know no end,
With endless possibilities near?
Would you build castles in the sky,
And reach for the farthest star?🫶🏽
Would you spread your wings and fly,"

The rustle of the trees."

"🍳 To finish this overly long thread from getting longer, I can finally let loose and talk about my absolute favorite aspect from S2: Sam and Pam."
"🍳 The season's approach to tackling propaganda and its effects it has on ignorant folk, as well as the youth that tries to fight for a sunnier tomorrow, are topics that, while relatively simple, are conveyed easily and accessible for it."
"🍳 The additions of Dookess and Dooka are just as fun to watch, seeing these bitter siblings spit bigotry at each other for something so minuscule. I would've loved to have seen more of them admittedly, acting as a C plot akin to Snerz's involvement, but they're a joy regardless."
"🍳 A small addition, but I appreciated seeing Michellee be given time off-screen to relax while not withdrawing her from the story entirely, instead becoming involved near the end and knocking some much-needed sense into Guy's noggin that motivates him to be better."
"🍳 Another aspect I really enjoyed was E.B. Just E.B. in general, getting to see her again and have her rebellious justice be challenged by adult interference. She's as spunky as ever and a joy to watch, not to mention her blooming connection with Looka over the season."
"🍳 This segues nicely into an aspect I really appreciate this season, that being Sam and Guy's friendship. Regardless of how long the timeskip is, you can tell these two have known each other long enough that they can be silly together yet still provide support to each other. https://t.co/Tklc1u2nHN"
"🍳 The characters have grown a bit since Season 1, now revolving around Guy being a family man and putting emphasis on Sam's desire to find his mother. There are new dynamics to explore here, and thus new drama that unfurls."
"🍳 First off, the art direction and animation are just as top-tier as Season 1's, and dare I say even more so in some aspects. New and returning animators give it their all, the shading's softer, and the backgrounds are just as beautiful, showing us new and inviting locales."

@micromarc98 My point was that for a new creative building a following on outrage clicks could result in inconsistent views when content that isn’t bait is posted! Also it’s probably mentally distressing reading some of the comments that go beyond dragging the behavior so yea iffy choice 😅
