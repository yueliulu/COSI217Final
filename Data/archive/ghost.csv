"3. Attainable

Your goal has to be realistic and attainable. Generally it should align with your current resources &amp; skill sets.

❌ - 'I want to make 3 million from info-product sales in 1 month'

✅ - 'My aim is to create 2 E-books in 2 months to generate $500 in sales'"
"1. Specificity

Be specific with what you want to achieve. Once you know EXACTLY what you want.. you will know exactly what steps to take..

❌ - 'I want to make more money in 2023'
